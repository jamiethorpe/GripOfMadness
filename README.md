# Grip of Madness

**Grip of Madness** is an action RPG I'm building in the Godot 4.2 engine. It's heavily inspired by *Diablo 2*, so expect similar vibesâ€”think dark dungeons, loot, and fast-paced combat.

This project is mainly a learning experience for me to get hands-on with Godot and game development in general.

Feel free to check out the code or clone the project if you're curious!
